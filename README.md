# calculator-tdd


I have implemented the solution with the TDD appouch. 
The source folder contains several separate projects:

- Web Api (Asp Net Core 5)
- Service (Class Library)
- Domain (Class Library)
- Unit Tests (xUnit)
- WPF Client (Net Core 5)
- Web Client (Vue)

I used the TDD approach for implementing the backend side. 
For automation of the process of the build, I used Azure pipelines integrated with the GitHub repository.
